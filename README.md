### Architecture
```
This application follows the the architecture single page application splitted in multiple components, so that I could reuse those components and deliver a good experience to the user. Also, I decide to create services in pure JavaScript in order to reuse then in other frameworks such as Angular, React or another else.
```
### Third party libraries
```
Vue.js for create JavaScript components
Axios for http requests due to the cross-browser compatibility 
```
